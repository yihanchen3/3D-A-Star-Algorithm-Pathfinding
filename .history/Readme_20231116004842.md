# 3D A* Pathfinding

This project implements a 3D A* pathfinding algorithm based on C++. 
The algorithm finds the shortest path between two input points in a 3D numerical matrix.


## How to Run

1. Compile the project with g++, and this while generate a executable `output`:

```bash
g++ .\3DAStar.cpp .\Star.cpp .\Node3D.cpp -o output
```

2. Run the resulting executable:

```bash
./output
```

## Files

- `Node3D.h`: This header file declares the `Point` structure and the `Node3D` class. The `Point` structure represents a point in 3D space. The `Node3D` class represents a node in the pathfinding graph.
- `Star.h`: This header file declares the `Star` class, which implements the A* algorithm. The `Star` class has methods for creating the graph (`Creatgraph()`) and finding the path (`Find_path()`).
- `Star.cpp`: This source file defines the `Star` class. It includes the implementation of the `Creatgraph()` and `Find_path()` methods.
- `3DAStar.cpp`: This source file contains the `main()` function. It creates an instance of the `Star` class and calls the `Find_path()` method to find the shortest path between two points in the graph.
- `input.txt`: This file contains the input numerical (0,1) matrix for the graph, where 0 stands for obstacle and 1 stands for free space.
- `output.exe`: This is the executable generated by the compiler, which allows users to input points and receive shortest path.

## Note

This project reads the graph data from an input file named `input.txt`. Make sure this file exists in the same directory as the executable. And if you want to change the input file, please change the file name in `3DAStar.cpp` line 10.

Please replace the `Creatgraph()` function in `Star.cpp` with your own implementation to read from the input file and populate the graph.

The map appears to be a 2D grid of 1s and 0s, where each number represents a cell in the grid. Typically, in the context of pathfinding algorithms like A*, 1s might represent traversable (free) cells and 0s might represent obstacles or non-traversable cells.

From the given excerpt, it seems like the majority of the grid is filled with 1s, indicating a largely open space. However, there is a block of 0s towards the end of the excerpt, which could represent an obstacle or a wall in the grid.

30x40000 is a very large grid. It is possible that the grid is not actually 30x40000, but rather 30x40 or 30x400. If the grid is indeed 30x40000, then it is likely that the grid is sparse, i.e. most of the cells are 1s and only a few are 0s. In this case, it would be more efficient to use a sparse matrix representation to store the graph.
