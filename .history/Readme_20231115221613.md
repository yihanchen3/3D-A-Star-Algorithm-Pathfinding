# 3D A* Pathfinding

This project implements a 3D A* pathfinding algorithm. The algorithm finds the shortest path between two points in a 3D space.

## Files

- `Node3D.h`: This header file declares the `Point` structure and the `Node3D` class. The `Point` structure represents a point in 3D space. The `Node3D` class represents a node in the pathfinding graph.
- `Star.h`: This header file declares the `Star` class, which implements the A* algorithm. The `Star` class has methods for creating the graph (`Creatgraph()`) and finding the path (`Find_path()`).
- `Star.cpp`: This source file defines the `Star` class. It includes the implementation of the `Creatgraph()` and `Find_path()` methods.

## How to Run

1. Compile the project with g++. Make sure to include both `Star.cpp` and your main file in the compilation. For example:

```bash
g++ Star.cpp main.cpp -o output
```


2. Run the resulting executable:
```bash
./output
```

****

## Note

This project reads the graph data from an input file named `inputt.txt`. Make sure this file exists in the same directory as the executable.

Please replace the `Creatgraph()` function in `Star.cpp` with your own implementation to read from the input file and populate the graph.
