# 3D A* Pathfinding

This project implements a 3D A* pathfinding algorithm based on C++. 
The algorithm finds the shortest path between two input points in a 3D numerical matrix.


## How to Run

1. Compile the project with g++, and this while generate a executable `output`:

```bash
g++ .\3DAStar.cpp .\Star.cpp .\Node3D.cpp -o output
```

2. Run the resulting executable:

```bash
./output
```

## Files

- `Node3D.h`: This header file declares the `Point` structure and the `Node3D` class. The `Point` structure represents a point in 3D space. The `Node3D` class represents a node in the pathfinding graph.
- `Star.h`: This header file declares the `Star` class, which implements the A* algorithm. The `Star` class has methods for creating the graph (`Creatgraph()`) and finding the path (`Find_path()`).
- `Star.cpp`: This source file defines the `Star` class. It includes the implementation of the `Creatgraph()` and `Find_path()` methods.
- `3DAStar.cpp`: This source file contains the `main()` function. It creates an instance of the `Star` class and calls the `Find_path()` method to find the shortest path between two points in the graph.
- `input.txt`: This file contains the input numerical (0,1) matrix for the graph, where 0 stands for obstacle and 1 stands for free space.
- `output.exe`: This is the executable generated by the compiler, which allows users to input points and receive shortest path.

## Note

This project reads the graph data from an input file named `input.txt`. Make sure this file exists in the same directory as the executable. And if you want to change the input file, please change the file name in `3DAStar.cpp` line 16.
